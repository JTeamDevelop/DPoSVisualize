# DPoSVisualize
Visualize Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) networks

Uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) to visualize DPoS networks through a [bubble chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269).  It pulls delegate and voter information from the network.  Currently it only works with the [Ark.io](https://ark.io/) network.
